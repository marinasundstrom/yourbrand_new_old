# E2E testing

End-to-end testing (E2E) is about testing a system from one end to another, frontend to backend. 

You perform some action through the frontend (typically a UI), then you verify in the backend (such as in the database) that the operation yielded the expected state.

These tests can be run in a QA environment, either manually, or automated.

There are currently no such tests yet.
