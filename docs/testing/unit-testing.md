# Unit testing

Unit tests is about testing certain components in isolation, using mocks as stand-ins for dependant components.

These are automated tests.

How to put together a unit test is a subject to debate. Generally, you should not test the code itself, but the behavior. 

Some developers advocate for Test-driven development (TDD) practices, that means that you write your software with testing in mind - also from the perspective on behavior.

## This solution

There are projects for unit testing, but they have not been utilized yet.

They will run as part of the workflow when pushing to GitHub.
